```
dotnet new -i BepInEx.Templates --nuget-source https://nuget.bepinex.dev/v3/index.json
```
- Open the .sln with Visual Studio 2022
- Rebuild Solution (This should download and install all nuget packages on compilation)

## Install to Tarkov
BepInEx 5 must be installed and configured first (see How to install BepInEx)
Place the built .dll in the BepInEx plugins folder

## Test in Tarkov
- Browse to where BepInEx is installed within your Tarkov folder
- Open config
- Open BepInEx.cfg
- Change the following setting [Logging.Console] Enabled to True
- Save the config file
- Run Tarkov through a launcher or bat file like this one (replacing the token with your ID)
```
start ./Clients/EmuTarkov/EscapeFromTarkov.exe -token=AID062158106353313252ruc -config={"BackendUrl":"https://localhost:7777","Version":"live"}
```
- If BepInEx is working a console should open and display the module "plugin" as started
